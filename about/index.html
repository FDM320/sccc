			<h4>	
				Hi there! I'm Ky, the Space Cadet herself!<br><br>
				I am my own entity inside of the Beautopia salon located at 501 Main Street, Vestal, NY, 13850.
				Beautopia is conveniently located just down the road from Four Corners!
				I offer a large array of services, including but not limited to: beautiful vibrant coloring services, waxing, kid's cuts, updos and extensions.
				I specialize in mens' cuts and facial grooming.
				With a relaxing atmosphere and grade A quality work done by yours truly, Beautopia is a fantastic place to bring your family where there is a service for everyone!
				I only accept business by appointment due to the fact that I am an independent contractor, and I will only be at the salon if I have appointments scheduled. 
				You can reach me on my Facebook page <a class="city_sunset_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/Space-cadets-custom-creations-305899680213043/?ref=br_rs">Space-Cadet's Custom Creations</a>.
				I have a full gallery of my collection and weekly deals to check out on Facebook!
				My prices are listed <a class="city_sunset_link" href="https://fdm320.github.io/sccc/prices/index.html">here</a> and also on my Facebook page. Please note that I only accept cash or checks for payment. <br><br>
				Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to see you in my chair soon for your next amazing style!
